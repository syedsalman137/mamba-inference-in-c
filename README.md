# mamba-inference-in-c

This repo runs Mamba models in C. We use tokenizer of Zephyr family of models, available on Huggingface.

Now runs at about the same speed as llama2.c when comparing mamba-130m vs llama-110m.

## Build and Run

Clone the repo on your device

```
git clone https://github.com/SalmanHabeeb/mamba-inference-in-c.git
```

and navigate to the folder:
```
cd mamba-inference-in-c
```

Build using
```
make runomp
```
Other build commands are listed inside [Makefile](https://github.com/SalmanHabeeb/mamba-inference-in-c/blob/main/Makefile)

Models can be downloaded from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ls-_WnTxlR9fvf8Mfii1B3Idf5M1jgES?usp=sharing) manually, or using gdown:

```
# For model
gdown https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cI6_LmfSuKLtgGNyOUbcQ2K_2h6a-KaL/view?usp=sharing --fuzzy

# For tokenizer
gdown https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qUjULatBdbrJaJqsJuTrtuWYt4G6GI2D/view?usp=sharing --fuzzy
```

Now run the model to generate text using:
```
OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 ./run "path/to/model"
```

and for chatting, use:
```
OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 ./run "path/to/model" -m chat
```

## Quantized models

You can download chat-finetuned quantized version of model using:

```
wget https://huggingface.co/SalmanHabeeb/quantized-mambas-c-format/resolve/main/mamba-2.8b-64g-zephyr.bin
```

To run quantized models, run any make command and:

```
OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 ./runq "path/to/model"
```

## Export

Also, models can be exported to required bin format by running

```
python export_model.py path/to/save/model --checkpoint "huggingface-chkpoint"
```

Also, tokenizer can be obtained by using:

```
python export_tokenizer.py path/to/save/tokenizer --tokenizer "huggingface-tokenizer"
```
